LumenCanvas v1.4 - Browser-Based Projection Mapping Studio

OVERVIEW:
LumenCanvas is a zero-install, browser-native projection mapping studio that allows users to create stunning visual projections with drag-warp simplicity, live GLSL/HTML coding capabilities, and portable ZIP exports. The application uses Vue 3 with Pixi.js for rendering, Clerk for authentication, and Netlify Blobs + KV for cloud storage.

2. Intuitive Projection Mapping
   - Drag-warp quad handles to fit target surfaces
   - Support for multiple media layers (image, video, URL, HTML, GLSL)
   - Real-time preview and full-screen projector mode
   
3. Live Code Editing
   - Integrated Monaco editor for GLSL shaders
   - HTML layer support for dynamic content
   - Plugin system for extensibility
   
4. AI-Powered Features
   - Webcam-based AI masking using ONNX runtime
   - Automatic surface isolation
   
5. Cloud Sync & Collaboration
   - Clerk-based authentication (email, passkey, social)
   - Project and asset sync across devices
   - Shareable project URLs with JWT tokens
