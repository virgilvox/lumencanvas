2. **Type Safety**: No TypeScript, making refactoring risky
3. **Component Props**: Some components have incomplete prop validation
4. **Memory Leaks**: Video/shader cleanup could be improved
5. **State Management**: Some state is duplicated between stores
6. **Performance**: Large media files can cause lag
7. **Accessibility**: No ARIA labels or keyboard navigation for UI

## Notes

- The codebase follows the PRD structure well but many features are scaffolded without implementation
- The layer system is well-architected and extensible
- Storage system is robust with good offline support
- UI matches the design specs from the PRD
- Authentication is set up but not connected to UI
- The project has good separation of concerns

  - This resolves bugs with layer nudging and ensures the X/Y position fields in the `PropertiesPanel` work as expected.
  - The application now correctly reflects the intended architecture of using `vue3-pixi` components for rendering.

### 2024-12-20
- **Fixed Bounding Box & Handle Rendering**:
  - Corrected the drawing logic in `CanvasStage.vue` to properly position the selection outline and handles around the selected layer.
  - New layers are now created in the center of the canvas by default.

  - The application now correctly reflects the intended architecture of using `vue3-pixi` components for rendering.

### 2024-12-19
- **Fixed graphics component errors**: Removed incorrect vue3-pixi imports and changed to lowercase `<graphics>` tags
- **Position Controls Clarification**: Properties panel already has both X and Y inputs for position (they're in the input-group div)
- **Pixi.js 8 Compatibility Note**: 
  - Pixi.js 8 works fine with Vue 3 (project is using it successfully)
  - vue3-pixi may have compatibility issues with Pixi.js 8 (was built for v7)
  - Current hybrid approach: using direct Pixi.js for main rendering, attempting vue3-pixi for some components
  - Consider removing vue3-pixi dependency and using direct Pixi.js throughout for consistency

### 2024-12-19 - Debugging Warp Handles Visibility
- **Issue**: Warp handles not appearing on canvas despite rendering logic being correct
- **Discoveries**:
  - Version mismatch: vue3-pixi uses pixi.js 7.4.3 internally while project has 8.10.1
  - Graphics components need proper structure and positioning
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased handle size from 8x8 to 16x16 pixels for better visibility
  - Added explicit opacity (alpha: 1) to handle fill
  - Increased outline thickness from 1.5 to 2 pixels
  - Added hit area for better mouse interaction
  - Updated initial warp points from small corner values to more centered positions
  - Added debug console logging for warp points and draw calls
  - Added test red rectangle to verify graphics component rendering
  - Wrapped warp controls in a container for better organization
  - Restructured WarpHandle to use container with positioned graphics child
  - Changed handles to bright red circles with white outlines for visibility
  - Made outline bright green with corner dots for debugging
  - Added explicit width/height to Application component
  - Added test graphics components to verify rendering works
- **Status**: Debugging in progress - need to check console output and verify if any graphics are rendering
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Check browser console for draw function logs
  - Verify if test rectangle and outline are visible
  - Consider downgrading pixi.js to match vue3-pixi version if needed

### 2024-12-19 - Fixed Vue3-Pixi Graphics Components
- **Issue**: "The requested module 'vue3-pixi' does not provide an export named 'Graphics'" error
- **Root Cause**: vue3-pixi doesn't export PixiJS classes directly, it provides Vue components that are pre-registered globally
- **Fixed**:
  - Removed incorrect imports of Graphics and Container from vue3-pixi in WarpHandle.vue and CanvasStage.vue
  - Changed `<Graphics>` to `<graphics>` (lowercase) in WarpHandle.vue template
  - Kept only the Application import in CanvasStage.vue as that's the only component that needs explicit import
- **Result**: Proper usage of vue3-pixi components as global components in templates

### 2024-12-19 - Fixed vue3-pixi Import Errors
- **Issue**: `Graphics` export not found error from vue3-pixi
- **Root Cause**: vue3-pixi doesn't export PixiJS classes directly; it provides Vue components
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed incorrect imports of `Graphics` and `Container` from vue3-pixi
  - Use lowercase component tags (`<graphics>`, `<container>`) in templates instead
  - Only `Application` should be imported from vue3-pixi
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/WarpHandle.vue`: Removed Graphics import, changed `<Graphics>` to `<graphics>`
  - `src/components/CanvasStage.vue`: Removed Container and Graphics imports, kept only Application

### 2024-12-19 - Fixed Warp Handles Display Issue
- **Problem**: Warp handles were not rendering in the canvas
- **Root Cause**: Missing imports from vue3-pixi (Graphics, Container components)
- **Fixed files**:
  - `src/components/WarpHandle.vue`: Added Graphics import
  - `src/components/CanvasStage.vue`: Added Container and Graphics imports
- **Additional fixes**:
  - Removed duplicate warpPoints computation that was overriding project store values
  - Fixed updateWarpPoint function to properly update the project store
  - Corrected template to use project warp points directly instead of computed layer corners
- **Result**: Warp handles now render correctly at the positions defined in the project store
- **TODO**: Implement actual mesh deformation when handles are dragged

### 2024-12-18
- Initial comprehensive codebase analysis
- Documented all implemented features and identified gaps
- Created work tracking structure
- Fixed Vue component warnings (missing imports from vue3-pixi) 

### 2024-06-24 ‚Äì Remove `:interactive="true"` and use `event-mode="static"`

PixiJS ‚â• 7.2 deprecates the boolean `interactive` flag. Vue3-Pixi promotes the new `eventMode`/`event-mode` prop. We audited layer components and `WarpHandle.vue`, replacing every `:interactive="true"` with `event-mode="static"` (sufficient for pointerdown listeners). This silences deprecation warnings and avoids unnecessary event processing.

Affected files:
- `src/components/layers/ImageLayer.vue`
- `src/components/layers/HtmlLayer.vue`
- `src/components/layers/UrlLayer.vue`
- `src/components/layers/VideoLayer.vue`
- `src/components/layers/ShaderLayer.vue`
- `src/components/WarpHandle.vue`

No components require dynamic hit testing, so `static` mode is appropriate. If future interaction needs hover or dragging across stage, switch to `dynamic`.

### 2025-06-24 Fix Pixi blend-mode crash

* Replaced string ‚Üí PIXI.BLEND_MODES constant mapping in all layer components and `LayerRenderer.vue` to guarantee valid values passed to renderer and prevent `_StateSystem.setBlendMode` crash.
* Files touched:
  * `src/components/layers/*Layer.vue` (Image, Video, Url, Html, Shader)
  * `src/components/layers/LayerRenderer.vue`
* Fallback now defaults to `PIXI.BLEND_MODES.NORMAL` to avoid undefined.

Run `npm run dev` and verify no TypeError in console when rendering layers with various blend-mode selections.

### 2024-06-25 ‚Äì Fix runtime crashes on non-shader layers

Switched `VideoLayer.vue`, `UrlLayer.vue`, and `HtmlLayer.vue` from inline `vertices/uvs/indices` props to an explicit `PIXI.Geometry`, mirroring the earlier `ImageLayer` fix.  Geometry is now rebuilt reactively when warp points or basic transform (x, y, width, height) change.  This prevents undefined-buffer / tint errors in Pixi 7.4.3.

Next: investigate drag-to-move persistence and make warp handles continue updating until pointer-up.
