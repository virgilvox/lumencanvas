3. **Component Props**: Some components have incomplete prop validation
4. **Memory Leaks**: Video/shader cleanup could be improved
5. **State Management**: Some state is duplicated between stores
6. **Performance**: Large media files can cause lag
7. **Accessibility**: No ARIA labels or keyboard navigation for UI

## Notes

- The codebase follows the PRD structure well but many features are scaffolded without implementation
- The layer system is well-architected and extensible
- Storage system is robust with good offline support
- UI matches the design specs from the PRD
- Authentication is set up but not connected to UI
- The project has good separation of concerns

  - Changed all component tags to lowercase (`<mesh>`, `<sprite>`) following vue3-pixi's global component registration pattern
  - Fixed files: `ShaderLayer.vue`, `ImageLayer.vue`, `VideoLayer.vue`, `HtmlLayer.vue`, `UrlLayer.vue`
  - This resolves the "vue3-pixi.js doesn't provide export named 'Mesh'" error
- **Layer Component Consistency**:
  - All layer types now follow the same pattern for warping and rendering
  - Warp-enabled layers use `<mesh>` component with vertices, uvs, and indices
  - Non-warped layers use `<sprite>` component with position and size properties
  - All layers support dragging via the pointerdown event emission

### 2024-12-21
- **Fixed UI & Interaction Bugs**:
  - Corrected layout in `PropertiesPanel` to properly display separate X/Y input fields for position and scale.
  - Fixed warp handle positioning to align with layer corners.
  - Implemented logic to move warp handles along with the layer when dragged.
  - Fixed event propagation for `pointerdown` to enable layer dragging.

  - This resolves bugs with layer nudging and ensures the X/Y position fields in the `PropertiesPanel` work as expected.
  - The application now correctly reflects the intended architecture of using `vue3-pixi` components for rendering.

### 2024-12-20
- **Fixed Bounding Box & Handle Rendering**:
  - Corrected the drawing logic in `CanvasStage.vue` to properly position the selection outline and handles around the selected layer.
  - New layers are now created in the center of the canvas by default.

  - The application now correctly reflects the intended architecture of using `vue3-pixi` components for rendering.

### 2024-12-19
- **Fixed graphics component errors**: Removed incorrect vue3-pixi imports and changed to lowercase `<graphics>` tags
- **Position Controls Clarification**: Properties panel already has both X and Y inputs for position (they're in the input-group div)
- **Pixi.js 8 Compatibility Note**: 
  - Pixi.js 8 works fine with Vue 3 (project is using it successfully)
  - vue3-pixi may have compatibility issues with Pixi.js 8 (was built for v7)
  - Current hybrid approach: using direct Pixi.js for main rendering, attempting vue3-pixi for some components
  - Consider removing vue3-pixi dependency and using direct Pixi.js throughout for consistency

### 2024-12-19 - Debugging Warp Handles Visibility
- **Issue**: Warp handles not appearing on canvas despite rendering logic being correct
- **Discoveries**:
  - Version mismatch: vue3-pixi uses pixi.js 7.4.3 internally while project has 8.10.1
  - Graphics components need proper structure and positioning
- **Changes Made**:
  - Increased handle size from 8x8 to 16x16 pixels for better visibility
  - Added explicit opacity (alpha: 1) to handle fill
  - Increased outline thickness from 1.5 to 2 pixels
  - Added hit area for better mouse interaction
  - Updated initial warp points from small corner values to more centered positions
  - Added debug console logging for warp points and draw calls
  - Added test red rectangle to verify graphics component rendering
  - Wrapped warp controls in a container for better organization
  - Restructured WarpHandle to use container with positioned graphics child
  - Changed handles to bright red circles with white outlines for visibility
  - Made outline bright green with corner dots for debugging
  - Added explicit width/height to Application component
  - Added test graphics components to verify rendering works
- **Status**: Debugging in progress - need to check console output and verify if any graphics are rendering
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Check browser console for draw function logs
  - Verify if test rectangle and outline are visible
  - Consider downgrading pixi.js to match vue3-pixi version if needed

### 2024-12-19 - Fixed Vue3-Pixi Graphics Components
- **Issue**: "The requested module 'vue3-pixi' does not provide an export named 'Graphics'" error
- **Root Cause**: vue3-pixi doesn't export PixiJS classes directly, it provides Vue components that are pre-registered globally
- **Fixed**:
  - Removed incorrect imports of Graphics and Container from vue3-pixi in WarpHandle.vue and CanvasStage.vue
  - Changed `<Graphics>` to `<graphics>` (lowercase) in WarpHandle.vue template
  - Kept only the Application import in CanvasStage.vue as that's the only component that needs explicit import
- **Result**: Proper usage of vue3-pixi components as global components in templates

### 2024-12-19 - Fixed vue3-pixi Import Errors
- **Issue**: `Graphics` export not found error from vue3-pixi
- **Root Cause**: vue3-pixi doesn't export PixiJS classes directly; it provides Vue components
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed incorrect imports of `Graphics` and `Container` from vue3-pixi
  - Use lowercase component tags (`<graphics>`, `<container>`) in templates instead
  - Only `Application` should be imported from vue3-pixi
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/WarpHandle.vue`: Removed Graphics import, changed `<Graphics>` to `<graphics>`
  - `src/components/CanvasStage.vue`: Removed Container and Graphics imports, kept only Application

### 2024-12-19 - Fixed Warp Handles Display Issue
- **Problem**: Warp handles were not rendering in the canvas
- **Root Cause**: Missing imports from vue3-pixi (Graphics, Container components)
- **Fixed files**:
  - `src/components/WarpHandle.vue`: Added Graphics import
  - `src/components/CanvasStage.vue`: Added Container and Graphics imports
- **Additional fixes**:
  - Removed duplicate warpPoints computation that was overriding project store values
  - Fixed updateWarpPoint function to properly update the project store
  - Corrected template to use project warp points directly instead of computed layer corners
- **Result**: Warp handles now render correctly at the positions defined in the project store
- **TODO**: Implement actual mesh deformation when handles are dragged

### 2024-12-18
- Initial comprehensive codebase analysis
- Documented all implemented features and identified gaps
- Created work tracking structure
- Fixed Vue component warnings (missing imports from vue3-pixi) 

### 2024-06-24 ‚Äì Remove `:interactive="true"` and use `event-mode="static"`

PixiJS ‚â• 7.2 deprecates the boolean `interactive` flag. Vue3-Pixi promotes the new `eventMode`/`event-mode` prop. We audited layer components and `WarpHandle.vue`, replacing every `:interactive="true"` with `event-mode="static"` (sufficient for pointerdown listeners). This silences deprecation warnings and avoids unnecessary event processing.

Affected files:
- `src/components/layers/ImageLayer.vue`
- `src/components/layers/HtmlLayer.vue`
- `src/components/layers/UrlLayer.vue`
- `src/components/layers/VideoLayer.vue`
- `src/components/layers/ShaderLayer.vue`
- `src/components/WarpHandle.vue`

No components require dynamic hit testing, so `static` mode is appropriate. If future interaction needs hover or dragging across stage, switch to `dynamic`.

### 2025-06-24 Fix Pixi blend-mode crash

* Replaced string ‚Üí PIXI.BLEND_MODES constant mapping in all layer components and `LayerRenderer.vue` to guarantee valid values passed to renderer and prevent `_StateSystem.setBlendMode` crash.
* Files touched:
  * `src/components/layers/*Layer.vue` (Image, Video, Url, Html, Shader)
  * `src/components/layers/LayerRenderer.vue`
* Fallback now defaults to `PIXI.BLEND_MODES.NORMAL` to avoid undefined.

Run `npm run dev` and verify no TypeError in console when rendering layers with various blend-mode selections.

### 2024-06-25 ‚Äì Fix runtime crashes on non-shader layers

Switched `VideoLayer.vue`, `UrlLayer.vue`, and `HtmlLayer.vue` from inline `vertices/uvs/indices` props to an explicit `PIXI.Geometry`, mirroring the earlier `ImageLayer` fix.  Geometry is now rebuilt reactively when warp points or basic transform (x, y, width, height) change.  This prevents undefined-buffer / tint errors in Pixi 7.4.3.

Next: investigate drag-to-move persistence and make warp handles continue updating until pointer-up.

# LumenCanvas Development Work Log

## Current Status: Fixing Vue/Pixi.js Integration Issues

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Vue Component Resolution Errors** - Fixed unresolved component warnings for `<ForeignObject>` and `<graphics>`
2. **TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toUpperCase')** - Fixed by:
   - Adding missing canvas properties (canvasWidth, canvasHeight, blendMode) to project store
   - Adding null checks before calling toUpperCase on blendMode
3. **Image/Video Loading Errors** - Fixed by:
   - Updating layer content structure to use `{ src: null }` for images and videos
   - Modifying createImageLayer and createVideoLayer to handle content.src properly
   - Adding proper error handling with try/catch blocks
4. **Layer Structure Issues** - Fixed by:
   - Changing position from nested object to flat x, y properties
   - Adding width and height properties to layers
   - Adding warp configuration to layer structure
   - Updating duplicateLayer to properly deep clone nested objects
5. **Missing File Upload Functionality** - Added:
   - File upload UI for image and video layers in PropertiesPanel
   - File input handlers for converting files to base64 data URLs
   - Preview display for uploaded images

### Current Architecture:
- **Vue 3** with Composition API
- **Pixi.js v8** (native, not vue3-pixi wrapper) for performance
- **Pinia** for state management
- **IndexedDB** for local storage
- **Netlify Functions** for cloud sync

### Next Steps:
1. Test file upload functionality with actual images/videos
2. Implement proper video playback controls in Pixi.js
3. Fix warp/distortion functionality
4. Add shader editor integration
5. Implement effects system 

## Session 1: Vue Component Resolution Fixes

### Fixed Vue3-Pixi Component Warnings
- Changed `<ForeignObject>` to `<foreignObject>` (lowercase) in multiple layer components
- Added proper imports for vue3-pixi components (Graphics, Sprite, Container, Mesh)
- Fixed component registration issues across the codebase

### Fixed Runtime Errors
1. **Missing Project Store Properties:**
   - Added `canvasWidth`, `canvasHeight`, and `blendMode` to project store
   - Updated projectData computed property
   - Added proper initialization in loadProject

2. **Layer Content Structure:**
   - Fixed image/video content to use `{ src: null }` structure
   - Updated layer creation functions to access `content.src`
   - Added proper error handling

3. **Layer Property Structure:**
   - Changed from nested position object to flat `x` and `y` properties
   - Added `width` and `height` properties (default 200x200)
   - Added warp configuration structure
   - Fixed duplicateLayer deep cloning

4. **File Upload Functionality:**
   - Added file upload UI in PropertiesPanel
   - Implemented FileReader for base64 conversion
   - Added image preview display
   - Styled upload buttons with Upload icon

## Session 2: Vue3-Pixi vs Direct Pixi.js Decision

### The Issue
- Initially attempted to use Pixi.js v8 directly
- Encountered version mismatch: vue3-pixi v0.9.6 expects Pixi.js v7, but v8 was installed
- This caused errors like `PIXI.Geometry is not defined`

### The Decision: Stick with Vue3-Pixi + Pixi.js v7
After careful consideration, we decided to use vue3-pixi with Pixi.js v7 for the following reasons:

#### Benefits of Vue3-Pixi:
1. **Declarative Component Syntax**: Clean, readable templates with familiar Vue patterns
2. **Reactive Updates**: Automatic re-rendering when Vue data changes
3. **Component Composition**: Easy to create reusable visual components
4. **Event Handling**: Native Vue event syntax (@pointerdown, @render, etc.)
5. **Vue DevTools Integration**: Inspect Pixi objects as Vue components

#### Can We Still Do Everything?
**YES!** Vue3-pixi with Pixi.js v7 supports all our advanced features:
- ‚úÖ **Mesh Warping**: Full access to PIXI.Mesh and custom geometries
- ‚úÖ **Custom Shaders**: PIXI.Shader.from() works perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Video Textures**: PIXI.Texture.from(video) supported
- ‚úÖ **Complex Geometries**: Full geometry manipulation capabilities
- ‚úÖ **Blend Modes**: All blend modes available
- ‚úÖ **Filters/Effects**: Full filter pipeline access

#### Implementation Approach:
- Removed conflicting Pixi.js v8 dependency
- Rewritten CanvasStage.vue using vue3-pixi components
- Maintained all advanced features (warping, shaders, etc.)
- Cleaner code with better Vue integration

### Example: Mesh Warping with Vue3-Pixi
```vue
<Mesh
  v-if="layer.warp?.enabled && warpMeshes[layer.id]"
  :geometry="warpMeshes[layer.id].geometry"
  :shader="warpMeshes[layer.id].shader"
  @pointerdown="onLayerPointerDown($event, layer)"
/>
```

The mesh geometry and shader are created using standard Pixi.js v7 APIs, then passed as props to the vue3-pixi Mesh component. Best of both worlds!

## Current Architecture

### Layer System
- **Types**: image, video, url, html, shader, text
- **Properties**: 
  - Position: `x`, `y` (flat properties)
  - Size: `width`, `height`
  - Visual: `opacity`, `blendMode`, `visible`
  - Warp: `{ enabled, points: [{x,y}, ...] }`
  - Content: Type-specific data

### Canvas Rendering (Vue3-Pixi)
- Uses `<Application>` component for Pixi app
- `<Container>` for layer grouping
- `<Sprite>` for images/videos
- `<Mesh>` for warped content and shaders
- `<Graphics>` for shapes and overlays
- Reactive updates via Vue watchers

### Storage System
- **Local**: IndexedDB via `idb` library
- **Cloud**: Netlify Functions + Blobs
- **Auto-save**: Every 30 seconds
- **Format**: JSON with base64 encoded assets

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Missing Layer Types**
   - Text layers with custom fonts
   - Proper HTML/URL rendering

2. **Complete Warp System**
   - Smooth handle dragging
   - Mesh subdivision controls
   - Perspective correction

3. **Effects System**
   - Port effects to Pixi filters
   - Real-time parameter adjustment
   - Effect stacking/ordering

4. **Shader Editor**
   - Monaco editor integration
   - Live preview
   - Uniform controls

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Texture caching
   - Layer culling
   - WebGL state management

6. **Export Features**
   - Canvas to image/video
   - Project packaging
   - Code generation
